  History of Programming:
  1) Initially there was only Machine Language(Binary code-> 0/1). It was very hard to understand, prone to errors, tedious and not scalable.

  2) Then came Assembly Language, which used mnemonics to represent machine instructions. It was easier to understand than machine language 
  but still required a deep understanding of the hardware and was not portable across different platforms.
  It was very highly tightly coupled. 
  Example: Mov A, 61H. It was also very prone to error, not scalable(Hardware badla toh code badalna padega).

  3) Then Procedural Programming came into existence. It introduced the concept of functions and procedures, allowing programmers to break down 
  their code into smaller, reusable pieces. 
  This made programming easier and more efficient, but it still had limitations in terms of code organization and maintenance.
  It has introduced everything except OOPs concept. Example: C, Pascal, Fortran, etc.

  4) Finally, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) was introduced, which focuses on the concept of objects and classes. 
    OOP allows programmers to create modular, reusable code that is easier to maintain and understand.
    OOps solved the problem of real world modeling, code reusability, and maintainability. It also introduced the concept of
 encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which are fundamental principles of OOP.
 It also solved the problem of data security, low scalability, and code reusability. It also made it easier to model real-world problems 
 and create complex software systems.

 OBJECTS: 
 Objects have characteristics and behaviours. 
 Example: Car
 Characteristics of Car: Engine, Brand, Model, Wheels etc
 Behaviour of Car: start(),stop(),gearShift(),accelerate(),brake()

 CLASS: 
 Blueprint of object. 

 Pillars Of OOPs:
 -> Abstraction
 -> Encapsulation
 -> inheritance
 -> Polymorphism
