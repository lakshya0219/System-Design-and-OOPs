Problems if we don't follow SOLID:
  -> Maintainability (matlab agar hume koi new feature introduce karna hoga toh minimum code changes hone chahiye);
  ->Readability (Code structure should not be tightly coupled)

S.O.L.I.D Principles:
S: Single Responsibility Principle
O: Open Close Principle
L: Liskov Substitution Principle
I: Interface Segregation Principle
D: Dependency Inversion Principle
